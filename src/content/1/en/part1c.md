<div class="content">

Let's go back to working with React.

We start with a new example:

```js
const Hello = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

const App = () => {
  const name = 'Peter'
  const age = 10

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name="Maya" age={26 + 10} />
      <Hello name={name} age={age} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Component helper functions

Let's expand our <i>Hello</i> component so that it guesses the year of birth of the person being greeted:

```js
const Hello = (props) => {
  // highlight-start
  const bornYear = () => {
    const yearNow = new Date().getFullYear()
    return yearNow - props.age
  }
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello {props.name}, you are {props.age} years old
      </p>
      <p>So you were probably born in {bornYear()}</p> // highlight-line
    </div>
  )
}
```

The logic for guessing the year of birth is separated into its own function that is called when the component is rendered.

The person's age does not have to be passed as a parameter to the function, since it can directly access all props that are passed to the component.

If we examine our current code closely, we'll notice that the helper function is actually defined inside of another function that defines the behavior of our component. In Java-programming, defining a method inside another method is not possible, but in JavaScript, defining functions within functions is a commonly used technique.

### Destructuring

Before we move forward, we will take a look at a small but useful feature of the JavaScript language that was added in the ES6 specification, that allows us to [destructure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) values from objects and arrays upon assignment.

In our previous code, we had to reference the data passed to our component as _props.name_ and _props.age_. Of these two expressions we had to repeat _props.age_ twice in our code.

Since <i>props</i> is an object

```js
props = {
  name: 'Arto Hellas',
  age: 35,
}
```

we can streamline our component by assigning the values of the properties directly into two variables _name_ and _age_ which we can then use in our code:

```js
const Hello = (props) => {
  // highlight-start
  const name = props.name
  const age = props.age
  // highlight-end

  const bornYear = () => new Date().getFullYear() - age

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello {name}, you are {age} years old</p>
      <p>So you were probably born in {bornYear()}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Note that we've also utilized the more compact syntax for arrow functions when defining the _bornYear_ function. As mentioned earlier, if an arrow function consists of a single command, then the function body does not need to be written inside of curly braces. In this more compact form, the function simply returns the result of the single command.

To recap, the two function definitions shown below are equivalent:
```js
const bornYear = () => new Date().getFullYear() - age

const bornYear = () => {
  return new Date().getFullYear() - age
}
```

Destructuring makes the assignment of variables even easier, since we can use it to extract and gather the values of an object's properties into separate variables:

```js
const Hello = (props) => {
    // highlight-start
  const { name, age } = props
    // highlight-end
  const bornYear = () => new Date().getFullYear() - age

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello {name}, you are {age} years old</p>
      <p>So you were probably born in {bornYear()}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<!-- Eli koska -->
If the object we are destructuring has the values
```js
props = {
  name: 'Arto Hellas',
  age: 35,
}
```

the expression <em>const { name, age } = props</em> assigns the values 'Arto Hellas' to _name_ and 35 to _age_.

We can take destructuring a step further:
```js
const Hello = ({ name, age }) => { // highlight-line
  const bornYear = () => new Date().getFullYear() - age

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello {name}, you are {age} years old
      </p>
      <p>So you were probably born in {bornYear()}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The props that are passed to the component are now directly destructured into the variables _name_ and _age_.

This means that instead of assigning the entire props object into a variable called <i>props</i> and then assigning its properties into the variables _name_ and _age_

```js
const Hello = (props) => {
  const { name, age } = props
```

we assign the values of the properties directly to variables by destructuring the props object that is passed to the component function as a parameter:

```js
const Hello = ({ name, age }) => {
```

### Page re-rendering

So far all of our applications have been such that their appearance remains the same after the initial rendering. What if we wanted to create a counter where the value increased as a function of time or at the click of a button?

Let's start with the following body:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const {counter} = props
  return (
    <div>{counter}</div>
  )
}

let counter = 1

ReactDOM.render(
  <App counter={counter} />, 
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

The root component is given the value of the counter in the _counter_ prop. The root component renders the value to the screen. But what happens when the value of _counter_ changes? Even if we were to add the command

```js
counter += 1
```

the component won't re-render. We can get the component to re-render by calling the _ReactDOM.render_ method a second time, e.g. in the following way:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const { counter } = props
  return (
    <div>{counter}</div>
  )
}

let counter = 1

const refresh = () => {
  ReactDOM.render(<App counter={counter} />, 
  document.getElementById('root'))
}

refresh()
counter += 1
refresh()
counter += 1
refresh()
```

The re-rendering command has been wrapped inside of the _refresh_ function to cut down on the amount of copy-pasted code.

Now the component  <i>renders three times</i>, first with the value 1, then 2, and finally 3. However, the values 1 and 2 are displayed on the screen for such a short amount of time that they can't be witnessed.

We can implement slightly more interesting functionality by re-rendering and incrementing the counter every second by using [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval):

```js
setInterval(() => {
  refresh()
  counter += 1
}, 1000)
```

Making repeated calls to the _ReactDOM.render_-method is not the recommended way to re-render components. Next, we'll introduce a better way of accomplishing this effect.

### Stateful component

All of our components up till now have been simple in the sense that they have not contained any state that could change during the lifecycle of the component.

Next, let's add state to our application's <i>App</i> component with the help of React's [state hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

We will change the application to the following:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react' // highlight-line
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0) // highlight-line

// highlight-start
  setTimeout(
    () => setCounter(counter + 1),
    1000
  )
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <div>{counter}</div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />, 
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

In the first row, the application imports the _useState_-function:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
```

The function body that defines the component begins with the function call:

```js
const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)
```

The function call adds <i>state</i> to the component and renders it initialized with the value of zero. The function returns an array that contains two items. We assign the items to the variables _counter_ and _setCounter_ by using the destructuring assignment syntax shown earlier.

The _counter_ variable is assigned the initial value of <i>state</i> which is zero. The variable _setCounter_ is assigned to a function that will be used to <i>modify the state</i>.

The application calls the [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) function and passes it two parameters: a function to increment the counter state and a timeout of one second:

```js
setTimeout(
  () => setCounter(counter + 1),
  1000
)
```

The function passed as the first parameter to the _setTimeout_ function is invoked one second after calling the _setTimeout_ function

```js
() => setCounter(counter + 1)
```

When the state modifying function _setCounter_ is called, <i>React re-renders the component</i> which means that the function body of the component function gets re-executed:

```js
(props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

  setTimeout(
    () => setCounter(counter + 1),
    1000
  )

  return (
    <div>{counter}</div>
  )
}
```

The second time the component function is executed it calls the _useState_ function and returns the new value of the state: 1. Executing the function body again also makes a new function call to _setTimeout_, which executes the one second timeout and increments the _counter_ state again. Because the value of the _counter_ variable is 1, incrementing the value by 1 is essentially the same as a command setting the state _counter_ value to 2.

```js
() => setCounter(2)
```
Meanwhile, the old value of _counter_,  "1", is rendered to the screen.

Every time the _setCounter_  modifies the state it causes the component to re-render. The value of the state will be incremented again after one second, and this will continue to repeat for as long as the application is running.

If the component doesn't render when you think it should, or if it renders at the "wrong time", you can debug the application by logging the values of the component's variables to the console. If we make the following additions to our code:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

  setTimeout(
    () => setCounter(counter + 1),
    1000
  )

  console.log('rendering...', counter) // highlight-line

  return (
    <div>{counter}</div>
  )
}
```

It's easy to follow and track the calls made to the _render_ function:

### Event handling

We have already mentioned <i>event handlers</i> a few times in [part 0](/en/part0), that are registered to be called when specific events occur. E.g. a user's interaction with the different elements of a web page can cause a collection of various different kinds of events to be triggered.

Let's change the application so that increasing the counter happens when a user clicks a button, which is implemented with the [button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)-element.

Button-elements support so-called [mouse events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent), of which [click](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click) is the most common event.

In React, registering an event handler function to the <i>click</i> event [happens](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) like this:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

  // highlight-start
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('clicked')
  }
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      // highlight-start
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        plus
      </button>
      // highlight-end
    </div>
  )
}
```

We set the value of the button's <i>onClick</i>-attribute to be a reference to the _handleClick_ function defined in the code.

Now every click of the <i>plus</i> button causes the _handleClick_ function to be called, meaning that every click event will log a <i>clicked</i> message to the browser console.

The event handler function can also be defined directly in the value assignment of the onClick-attribute:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <button onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}> // highlight-line
        plus
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

By changing the event handler to the following form
```js
<button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
  plus
</button>
```

we achieve the desired behavior, meaning that the value of _counter_ is increased by one <i>and</i> the component gets re-rendered.

Let's also add a button for resetting the counter:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
        plus
      </button>
      // highlight-start
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(0)}> 
        zero
      </button>
      // highlight-end
    </div>
  )
}
```

Our application is now ready!

Defining event handlers directly inside JSX-templates is usually not a wise move. Let's extract the event handler functions into their own separate helper functions:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

// highlight-start
  const increaseByOne = () =>
    setCounter(counter + 1)
  
  const setToZero = () =>
    setCounter(0)
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <button onClick={increaseByOne}> // highlight-line
        plus
      </button>
      <button onClick={setToZero}> // highlight-line
        zero
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Event handlers are functions

The functions _increaseByOne_ and _setToZero_ work almost exactly the same way, they just set a new value for the counter. Let's write a new function that serves both cases.

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

  const setToValue = (value) => setCounter(value) // highlight-line

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <button onClick={setToValue(counter + 1)}> // highlight-line
        plus
      </button>
      <button onClick={setToValue(0)}> // highlight-line
        zero
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

We realize, however, that this change breaks our application entirely:

![](../../images/1/5a.png)

What's causing the application to break? The event handler is supposed to define a <i>reference to a function</i>. However, in our code we have defined:

```js
<button onClick={setToValue(0)}>
```

meaning that the event handler is actually a <i>function call</i>, not a reference to the function. As a general rule, there is nothing wrong with this, but in this particular case the <em>setToValue(0)</em> function is called when React renders the component. This function then makes a call to the _setCounter_ function, which in turn causes the component to be re-rendered. And this cycle goes on and on...

There are two potential solutions to this problem. The simpler solution is to change the event handlers into the form shown below:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

  const setToValue = (value) => setCounter(value)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setToValue(counter + 1)}> // highlight-line
        plus
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setToValue(0)}> // highlight-line
        zero
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The event handler is now a <i>function</i> that calls the _setToValue_ function with the appropriate parameter:

```js
<button onClick={() => setToValue(counter + 1)}>
```

### Function that returns a function

Another solution is to use a common trick often seen in JavaScript and functional programming at large. The trick is to define <i>a function that returns a function</i>:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

// highlight-start
  const setToValue = (value) => {
    return () => {
      setCounter(value)
    }
  }
// highlight-end  

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <button onClick={setToValue(counter + 1)}> // highlight-line
        plus
      </button>
      <button onClick={setToValue(0)}> // highlight-line
        zero
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Getting comfortable with this technique may take some time if this is your first time using it.

We have defined the following _setToValue_ event handler function:

```js
const setToValue = (value) => {
  return () => {
    setCounter(value)
  }
}
```

Defining the event handler by calling <em>setToValue(0)</em> results in the function

```js
() => {
  setCounter(0)
}
```

which is exactly the desired function for resetting the state!

The event handler for the plus button is defined by calling <em>setToValue(counter + 1)</em>. When the component is rendered for the first time, the _counter_ will have the initial value 0, meaning that the event handler for the plus-button will be the result of <em>setToValue(1)</em>:

```js
() => {
  setCounter(1)
}
```

Likewise, when the state of the counter is 41 the event handler for the plus-button will be:

```js
() => {
  setCounter(42)
}
```

Let's take a closer look at the _setToValue_ function:

```js
const setToValue = (value) => {
  return () => {
    setCounter(value)
  }
}
```

Because the function body only contains a single command, we can once again utilize the more compact arrow function syntax:

```js
const setToValue = (value) => () => {
  setCounter(value)
}
```

In these situations it's common to write everything onto one line, resulting in a "double arrow" function: 

```js
const setToValue = (value) => () => setCounter(value)
```

Double arrow functions can be thought of as functions that have to be called twice in order to get the final result.

The first function call is used to "configure" the second function, by defining some of its parameters. By calling <em>setToValue(5)</em> we assign the value 5 to _value_ and we're left with the following function:

```js
() => setCounter(5)
```

This way of utilizing functions that return functions is effectively the same thing as [currying](https://web.archive.org/web/20170919010057/http://www.datchley.name/currying-vs-partial-application/) in functional programming. The term currying does not originate from functional programming, rather the term is deeply rooted in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying).

We've mentioned <i>functional programming</i> a few times now, which may not be familiar to everyone. We will explore some aspects of functional programming throughout the course, as React supports and partially requires the use of some of the styles of functional programming.

**NB** the change where we replaced the functions _increaseByOne_ and _setToZero_ with the function _setToValue_ is not necessarily an improvement, since specialized functions have more descriptive names. The reason we made the change was mostly to demonstrate the usage of the _currying_-technique.

**NB** You don't necessarily need to use functions that return functions in any of the exercises, so don't worry too much about understanding this technique if the topic seems particularly confusing.

### Passing state to child components

It's recommended to write React components that are small and reusable across the application and even across projects. Let's refactor our application so that it's composed of three smaller components, one component for displaying the counter and two components for buttons.

Let's first implement a <i>Display</i> component that's responsible for displaying the value of the counter.

One best practice in React is to [lift the state up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) as high as possible in the component hierarchy, preferably to the <i>App</i> root component.

Let's place the application's state in the <i>App</i> component and pass it down to the <i>Display</i> component through <i>props</i>:

```js
const Display = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>{props.counter}</div>
  )
}
```

We can also utilize [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) directly in the component function's parameters. Since we're interested in the _counter_ property of the props object, it's possible to simplify the component into the following form:

```js
const Display = ({ counter }) => {
  return (
    <div>{counter}</div>
  )
}
```

Since the component function only consists of a single command we can also use the compact syntax for arrow functions:

```js
const Display = ({ counter }) => <div>{counter}</div>
```

Using the component is straightforward, as we only need to pass the state of the _counter_ to component:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)
  const setToValue = (value) => setCounter(value)

  return (
    <div>
      <Display counter={counter}/> // highlight-line
      <button onClick={() => setToValue(counter + 1)}>
        plus
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setToValue(0)}>
        zero
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Everything still works. When the buttons are clicked and the <i>App</i> gets re-rendered, all of its children including the <i>Display</i> component are also re-rendered.

Next, let's make a <i>Button</i> component for the buttons of our application. We have to pass the event handler as well as the title of the button through the component's props:

```js
const Button = (props) => (
  <button onClick={props.onClick}>
    {props.text}
  </button>
)
```

and let's utilize destructuring again to unpack and assign the needed properties from the props object to variables:

```js
const Button = ({ onClick, text }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>
    {text}
  </button>
)
```

Our <i>App</i> component now looks like this:

```js
const App = (props) => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)
  const setToValue = (value) => setCounter(value)


  return (
    <div>
      <Display counter={counter}/>
      // highlight-start
      <Button
        onClick={setToValue(counter + 1)}
        text='plus'
      />
      <Button
        onClick={setToValue(counter - 1)}
        text='minus'
      />
      <Button
        onClick={setToValue(0)}
        text='zero'
      />
      // highlight-end
    </div>
  )
}
```

Since we now have an easily reusable <i>Button</i> component, we've also implemented new functionality into our application by adding a button that can be used to decrement the counter.

The event handler is passed to the <i>Button</i> component through the _onClick_ prop. The name of the prop itself is not that significant, but our naming choice wasn't completely random, e.g. React's own official [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) suggests this convention.
